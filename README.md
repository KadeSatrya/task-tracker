# Task Tracker
My personal project for learning PHP and Laravel. Based on the assignment from my Platform Based Programming course which used Django instead of Laravel. It has a basic CRUD feature which includes:
- Creating task
- Reading created task
- Updating task completion status
- Deleting task
